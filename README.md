# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analysis of Kickstarter dataset

### Purpose
To review comparable Kickstarter campaign outcomes to Louise's play *Fever* in relation to launch dates and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges
I compiled theater outcomes by launch date and initial campaign fundraising goals into separate tables to isolate predictors of campaign success, then created line charts for each variable to visually communicate results. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Filtering data to show successful, failed and canceled plays based on which month each play launched to show correlation of launch timing and overall success of projects


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Filtering data to show percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays based on initial fundraising goals in $5,000 increments to show likelihood of success in relation to cost of production

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no canceled plays in the dataset so I could not provide percentages of that outcome. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Plays that launched in summer months, specifically May-June, saw more success than plays launched in winter months. The number of plays that failed month-to-month was fairly consistent, regardless of season. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower range of fundraising goals (<$1,000-$15,000) saw more positive success rates, while success rates drastically declined above $40,000. The two most optimal ranges for fundraising goals related to successful outcomes is <$1,000-$4,999 and $35,000-$44,999. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Data used to analyze outcomes does not include location, which may show more variation of success when comparing cities with higher or lower populations, average cost of living and disposable income, or accessibility of theater relative to public transit. In addition, the most recent data included is 4 years old, which may not reflect accurate entertainment industry spending mid-pandemic, and therefore not a valid predictor of future trends. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A stacked bar chart to show proportion of successful Kickstarters by category and location to reflect demand relative to the market
